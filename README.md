**Customer Segmentation using KMeans**

Developed a customer segmentation model using KMeans Clustering to group customers based on spending behavior, annual income, and age. The dataset included 5 features. The model segmented customers into distinct clusters, ensuring quick and efficient analysis. Results were visualized through a 3D scatter plot, with clusters highlighted by color to clearly interpret patterns.

**Output Insights**

The 3D scatter plot visualizes the clustering results by plotting customers based on their spending behavior, annual income, and age. Each cluster is represented by a distinct color, making it easy to identify key customer segments. The spatial distribution of the clusters shows how different age groups and spending patterns correlate
